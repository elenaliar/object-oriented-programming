# object-oriented-programming
these projects were part of my object-oriented-programming course in the second year of my bachelor's degree <br /><br />
**Project 1** <br />
This program tries to make a school environment and then moves the students fromthe school yard into the classes that they belong to if the teacher of their class has not entered the class yet. Language: c++

(In this project there were some restrictions. Those were that I could not use libriaries of c++ such us vector,array,list. The only libriary I was alowed was the string labriary. And I was not allowed to use Inheritance.) <br /> <br />

**Project 2** <br />
This program tries to make pairs of Students that are in a kindergarten by trying to make pairs of the opposite sex(they have to be students of the same class). Also, those students can create a mess and the program has to change the pairs accordingly(only then can students from different classes be paired). Language: c++

(In this project there were some restrictions. Those were that I could not use libriaries of c++ such us vector,array,list. The only libriary I was alowed was the string labriary. And I was not allowed to use Inheritance.)<br /> <br />

**Project 3** <br />
similar to project only now i can make use of the opportunities that inheritance gives, also i have to calculate the fatigue of the teachers and students as the schools opperates for N hours. Language: C++<br /> <br />

**Project 4** <br />
similar to project 3 only now it is implemented in Java
