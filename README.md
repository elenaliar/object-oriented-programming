# object-oriented-programming
these projects were part of my object-oriented-programming course in the second year of my bachelor's degree <br /><br />
**Project 1** <br />
This program tries to make a school environment and then moves the students fromthe school yard into the classes that they belong to if the teacher of their class has not entered the class yet. Language: c++

(In this project there were some restrictions. Those were that I could not use libriaries of c++ such us vector,array,list. The only libriary I was alowed was the string labriary. And I was not allowed to use Inheritance.)
